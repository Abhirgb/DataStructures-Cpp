we can create 2d array in 3 different ways
1) declaring a 2D array
EX:- int A[3][4];
2) declaring an 1D array of integer pointers
EX:- int *A[3];
3) declaring a double pointer
EX:- int **A;

how are 2D arrays managed or handled by a compiler:-

all elements of the array are stored in a linear continuous memory

the mapping of 2D elements to linear continuos memory is done in 2 ways:-
1) Row Major mapping
-> elements are stored Row by Row
2) Column Major Mapping
