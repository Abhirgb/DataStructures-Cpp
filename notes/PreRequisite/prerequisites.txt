array is collection of similar data elements

ex:- int A[5] if each integer is 2 bytes then the size of this array is 10 bytes.

the program runs in the main memory.
main memory consists of 
1 - code section
2 - stack
3 - heap

if an array is declared in the program it is created in the stack.


STRUCTUREs:-
collection of related data members under one name.
the may or may not be of same type 

size:-
if assumed size of int is 2bytes
struct Rect
{
   int iLength;  ------- 2 bytes
   int iBreadth; ------- 2 bytes
}
so when a variable of above structure is created its size is of 4 bytes in memory
so basically a size of a struct is sum of memory consumed by all its members 

declaration - struct Rect r; //created in stack

ex:- of structures

complexnumbers - a+ib

struct ComplexNumber
{
  float fReal;
  float fImaginary;
}

char takes 1byte of memory

so char name[25];  //occupies 25bytes of memory
