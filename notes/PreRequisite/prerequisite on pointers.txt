pointer is an address variable, meant for storing address of data.
used to access data indireclty

why?????

program can access the stack and code section in main memory directly.
but not heap.(not accessed directly)(this memory is external to the program)

so we can use pointer here to access this heap memory(above is one of the reason to use pointers)
pointers can be used to access the resources tha are outside the program
parameter passing

int a; //2bytes   a at - 201,202(addresses) //data variable
int *p; //2bytes  p at - 300,301(addresses) //Address Variable
p = &a;

accessing variable in heap memory:-

to create memory in heap in C, "malloc" is used.(memory allocation - malloc())
in C++, "new" key word is used

if i need 5 integers memory in heap.(should be mentioned in terms of BYTES)
using sizeof() operator lets complier decide the size of int.
since every primitive datatype memory is compiler dependent 

int *p;
p = (int *)malloc(5*sizeof(int)); \\C style heap memory creation
NOTE: malloc always returns a void* typecasting to appropriate data type should be taken care

p = new int[5]; \\c++ style heap memory allocation

size of a pointer of any type is same as the size of int(varies from compiler to compiler).

REFERENCE:

mostly useful in parameter passing
