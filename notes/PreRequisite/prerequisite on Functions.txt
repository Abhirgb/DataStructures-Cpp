parameters passed in the function call are "Actual Parameters"
Ex:- add(x,y);

parameters in the function declaration or defination are called "Formal Parameters"
Ex:- int add(int a, int b);

when ever there is a function call in the code its own action record (or) stack frame is created in the stack.
same as the main when the program executes first an activation record of the main function is created

when ever call by reference is used no new stack frame or activation record is created.it uses the stack frame where the function call is made.
and code is executed there in the main memory.

array can not be passed by values at all.they can only be passed by address

void func(int A[], int n)
{
}

or

void func(int *A, int n)
{
}

int main()
{
	int a[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
	func(a, 5)
}

Returning an array from a function

int [] func(int n) \\int* func(int n)
{
	int *p;
	p = (int *)malloc(n*size(int)); \\p = new int[n];
	return p;
}

int main()
{
	int *A;
	A = func(5);
}
