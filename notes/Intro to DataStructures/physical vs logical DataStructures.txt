PHYSICAL:-

Array and LinkedLists.

we can have more physical data structures by taking the combination of them.

these decides or defines how the memory(where data can be stored) is organised or how the memory is allocated.

Arrray - collection of contigeous memory locations.that are side by side
	 might be created in stack as well as heap.
	 size or length is static or fixed.
LinkedList - is a dynamic data structure.
	     is a collection of nodes containing the data and the address to the next node.
	     always created in heap.
	     size or length is dynamic
physical data structures are meant for storing the data in them.

LOGICAL:-

linear:-
	stack(works on the decipline LIFO(LAST In FIRST Out).)
	queue(works on the decipline FIFO(FIRST In FIRST Out))
non linear:-
	tree(collection of nodes and the link between nodes.(Organised hierarchially))
	graph

hash table(linear or tabular)

Logical data structures - How the data needs to be accessed.(like in which order or decipline to followed etc.. or how to utilise the data)

The Logical data structures are implemented using the physical data structures.
